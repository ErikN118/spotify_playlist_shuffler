Good shuffle for spotify playlists

This project shuffles a playlist of your choice the right way.
What does the right way mean you ask?
Well spotify shuffles your playlist in such a way that songs can come up multiple times in a row or multiple times quickly after one another.
I fixed it by letting this program create a new playlist that is the old (source) playlist but shuffled.
Each song appears once in the new playlist.

It's not really user friendly right now, as you can't actually use it without figuring some stuff out and changing some variables but I'm looking into fixing that eventually.

Code will be added later
